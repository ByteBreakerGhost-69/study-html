📘 Learning HTML in 2 Days
Hi there! 👋
I've just completed an intensive 2-day learning journey diving into HTML. Even though the time was short, I made the most of it by focusing on the core concepts and essential HTML elements that form the foundation of web development.

🧠 What I’ve Learned So Far
During these two days, I managed to cover and practice:
-Basic HTML structure
-Headings and paragraphs
-Images and links
-Ordered and unordered lists
-Tables (including rowspan and colspan)
-Forms: text input, password, date, radio buttons, checkboxes, textarea, select/dropdown
-<fieldset> and <legend> usage
-Introduction to semantic HTML elements

📁 About This Repository
This repository contains my personal HTML practice files.
So far, only a portion of the files have been uploaded, as I'm still organizing and reviewing them.

🙏 Apologies in advance if the current structure or file naming seems a bit messy.
This is still a work in progress — I’m planning to clean up and organize the files to make them easier to read and understand, especially for anyone who’s also learning.

⏳ What’s Coming Next?
In the next update (planned for tomorrow), I’ll:
-Upload the rest of the exercises
-Clean up and restructure folders/files
-Add comments and explanations to the code
-Begin integrating basic CSS

✍️ Personal Note
I truly enjoyed this learning process. I’ve realized that HTML is more than just writing tags — it's about organizing content properly, using semantic elements, and building a strong foundation for any website.

I know this is just the beginning of my web development journey, but I’m proud of what I’ve achieved so far — and I’m excited to keep going.

Thank you for visiting this repository!
Feel free to explore, use, or learn from the code here.
I’m always open to suggestions, improvements, or collaboration.

And again — thank you for your patience, and sorry if things are still a bit rough. 🙏
